"""
Project Chimera Test Suite

This package contains comprehensive tests for the Chimera AI agent system.
Tests are organized following TDD principles - they define the contracts
that implementations must fulfill.

Test Structure:
- unit/: Unit tests for individual components
- integration/: Integration tests for component interactions
- e2e/: End-to-end workflow tests

All tests should initially FAIL - this is expected and correct.
They define the "empty slots" that implementations must fill.
