# Project Chimera - 10Academy Week 0 Phase 2

## Overview
Project Chimera is an advanced AI agent swarm system designed for autonomous digital intelligence with economic capabilities and social interaction features.

## Architecture
- **FastRender Swarm Intelligence**: Hierarchical agent coordination
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Universal AI interface integration
- **Economic Sovereignty**: Blockchain-based autonomous transactions
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Governance and quality assurance

## Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/IbnuEyni/Project_Chimera_AI-agent_Infrastructure-Challenge-.git
cd Project_Chimera_AI-agent_Infrastructure-Challenge-

# Setup environment
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Install development dependencies
make install-dev

# Run tests
make test

# Start development server
make serve
```

## Enterprise Features
- **10,000+ Concurrent Agents** - Massive scale coordination
- **<2 Second Response Time** - Ultra-low latency processing
- **Zero-Trust Security** - Enterprise-grade protection
- **Economic Sovereignty** - Autonomous financial transactions
- **200+ MCP Integrations** - Universal AI service connectivity
- **Kubernetes Native** - Cloud-ready deployment
